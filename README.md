# S05_TestingGrounds

This is part of the Unreal Course presented by Ben Tristem on Udemy.

The full course is part of [this](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bentristem/learn-to-make-video-games-unreal-developer-course) Kickstarter campaign which was over 1000% funded.

This course is exclusively hosted on Udemy.com, and has many hours of high-quality videos.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files!

The course content is not mine, I am mearly following the tutorials to learn and this is my repo. These are just the files I created from following the course.

I highly recommend the complete course.

Cheers,
Jason Blignaut
